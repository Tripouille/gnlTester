# gnlTester (2019+)
Tester for the get next line project of 42 school (with personalized leaks checking on mac, using valgrind on linux)  
If all your tests are OK and the moulinette KO you, please contact me on slack/discord.  
Clone this tester in your get_next_line repository, or somewhere else and customize the path to your get_next_line project by changing the GNL_PATH variable inside the Makefile. (works on linux and mac, handles sigsegv on all tests, and timeout on mandatory part)

# Commands
make m = launch mandatory tests  
make b = launch bonus tests  
make a = launch mandatory tests + bonus tests 

make dockerm = launch mandatory tests in linux container  
make dockerb = launch bonus tests in linux container  
make dockera = launch mandatory tests + bonus tests in linux container  
Thanks to gurival- for the docker idea (https://github.com/grouville/valgrind_42)  

You can change the timeout value in Makefile

*FOR RIGOROUS TEST YOU SHOULD RUN ALL TESTS WITH VALGRIND USING LINUX (make docker...)*

MOK / MKO = test about your malloc size (this shouldn't be tested by moulinette)
